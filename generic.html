              Story
            </h1>
            <p>
              My name is Fabio Hinojosa Jimenez,<br />
              I was born in
              <strong>Cochabamba, Bolivia </strong>
              where I spent almost all my life.<br />
              I moved to the U.S. in 2021 to pursue my Bachelor's degree in
              <strong> Computer Science</strong>
            </p>
          </header>
          <div class="image main">
            <img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            I consider myself an active and curious person who loves to learn as
            much as possible on a daily basis. I am currently pursuing my
            Bachelor's in Computer Science and expect to graduate in December
            2024. Throughout my four years of college, I have been involved in a
            vast array of groups, clubs, and communities. I served as the
            president of the robotics club and the ACM Chapter, participating in
            various competitions, including the International Collegiate
            Programming Contest (ICPC), NASA Lunabotics, National Cyber League
            (NCL), and many others.

            <br />
            <br />
            Because of my good grades and dedication, I was also given the
            opportunity to work as a Computer Peer Tutor (CPT), a job for which
            I am very thankful and happy. In this role, I tutored students with
            their programming homework and organized events like game jams and
            workshops, with the purpose of engaging students and helping them
            learn more about the vast world of computer science. While doing all
            this, I still found time to participate in the volleyball club,
            traveling to regional and national championships throughout the
            semester. This engagement allowed me to meet new professors who
            provided me with the opportunity to work as a research assistant,
            creating a VR cybersecurity training program for new IT hires.
            Additionally, I worked on AI and computer vision technologies in my
            second research assistant position.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hard work reflects the passion I have for computer science and
            for helping people by creating solutions using the knowledge I
            acquire in school. In Bolivia, I had a vision to help not only my
            community but as many people as I could. Coming to the U.S., I
            wanted nothing more than to make that vision a reality. My dream is
            to continue pursuing this passion and to keep helping people while
            doing what I love.
